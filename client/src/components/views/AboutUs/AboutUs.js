      <h2>About Khudkaar</h2>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Khud Kaar is a social enterprise working to create employment
        opportunities for un-employed and lift them up from scratch. It is
        committed to get them access to market and help them in setting their
        businesses. It is specifically designed to help unemployed women and the
        hostelite students. Its aim is to enable women to sell their home-made
        products such as hygienic food, beautiful art work and amazing
        handicrafts, and to allow students to get all these products at
        affordable prices. Our system would have a single admin site, where our
        only vendor would be able to upload products of the clients who have
        contacted the vendor. Admin would also be able to upload the success
        stories, upcoming events, the new projects, links to video lectures (for
        training purposes) on the web site. Next comes our customers, who can
        either go, search, choose and select the required product or go for
        other services using the navigation bars on our home page. We have
        different categories and tags for our products e.g. breakfast, lunch,
        dinner, desserts, food of the day, most liked dish, pants, shirts,
        paintings, greeting cards and so on. Customers will get the complete
        details of the product by just clicking on the specific product. We will
        also have the review section for our products where our customers can
        give us feedback related to our products and services. When the
        customers confirm their order, they would provide their details like
        their full name, contact number, complete home address and email address
        to our vendor which then proceeds the order. There is no online payment
        option yet, so our customers will pay through cash on delivery. The
        amount received would then be distributed by the vendor to seller and
        delivery person.
